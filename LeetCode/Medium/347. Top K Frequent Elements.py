# Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1]
# Note:

# You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ number of unique elements.
# Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.

#Approach: We can iterate through the nums array to create a dict, then iterate through the dict:
#The first time we will create a dictionary with the count of each nums
#The second time we will create a new dictionary that takes the count of each element, and uses it as a key with the number as the value
#Since we know the most amount of time an element can appear is len(nums), (as in it is the only number that appears): 
#We can can iterate through the len (nums), going -1 each step, and add all the values of that count in our second dictionary our output array

#To illustrate it better: 
# Say our nums array is length 3: We check to see if there are elements that have a count of 3 in our second dictionary, and then we add every single one of those nums to our output
#Then we go 3-1 = 2: We check to see if there are elements with a count of 2.. and so on. This way we ensure that we are adding our elements with the highest count
