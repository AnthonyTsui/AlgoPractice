# Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

# Example:
# Given a binary tree
#           1
#          / \
#         2   3
#        / \     
#       4   5    
# Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

# Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

#Approach: Depth first Search
